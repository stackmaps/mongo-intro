# mongo-intro

Intermediate learning project introducing PyMongo, the Python driver for MongoDB.

In this project, you will write your own database interface code.  An interface is simply a piece of code that serves as an intermediary between one piece of software and another (or between a piece of software and a human).  

## Difficulty Level:  INTERMEDIATE

You should be comfortable with Python, understanding functions, try/except statements, the `input()` function, and data types.  You should be willing to accept some abstraction, e.g., willing to not understand every single detail underneath the code you import.  You should be able to read documentation in order to learn how to install MongoDB and PyMongo on your computer.

## The Story

One day, in the very far future, books become a scarce commodity.  You decide to take it upon yourself to create a database instance which will enable you to digitize the characters from Charlotte's Web, thereby preserving the memory of this historic creative masterwork for all time.

## What you will learn

In this project, you will learn about:
* MongoDB
* differences between PyMongo and the Mongo Shell
* CRUD operations
